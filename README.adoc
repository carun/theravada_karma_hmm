= Abstract

This project presents a simple computational model of karma and
mental defilements (kilesas) based on canonical Thēravāda Buddhist
sources, implemented as a Hidden Markov Model. The model bridges
traditional Buddhist psychology with modern computational frameworks to
enable rigorous scientific investigation of contemplative mental
dynamics, meditation effects, and long-term computational psychological
evolution.

== Theoretical Foundation

=== Buddhist Psychology Overview

Thēravāda Buddhism presents a sophisticated psychological framework
centered on the dynamics of karma (intentional action) and kilesas
(mental defilements). This system, codified in texts like the Abhidhamma,
Suttas offers precise taxonomies of mental states and their causal relationships.

*Core Principles*

- *Cetana (Intention)*: The mental factor that creates karmic consequences
- *Kilesas (Defilements)*: Mental factors that cloud judgment and drive unwholesome actions
- *Vipaka (Results)*: The ripening of karmic seeds across multiple timescales
- *Path Development*: Progressive elimination of defilements through contemplative practice

=== Canonical Sources

The model incorporates kilesas from canonical Abhidhamma and Sutta sources only:

. *The 10 Abhidhamma Defilements* (Dhammasangani, Vibhanga):
* greed (lōbha), hatred (dōsa), delusion (mōha)
* conceit (māna), wrong view (micchā-diṭṭhi), doubt (vicikicchā)
* sloth & torpor (thīna), restlessness (uddhacca)
* shamelessness (ahirika), recklessness (anōttappa)

. *The 10 Fetters (Saṃyojanas)*:
* Lower fetters (eliminated at Stream Entry): personality view, doubt, rites/rituals
* Higher fetters: sensual desire, ill-will, form/formless desires, conceit, restlessness, ignorance

. *The 16 Defilements* (Vatthupama Sutta, MN 7):
* Covetousness, unrighteous greed, ill-will, anger, hostility, denigration, domineering, envy, jealousy, hypocrisy, fraud, obstinacy, presumption, conceit, arrogance, vanity, negligence

* *The 5 Hindrances (Sutta Pitaka)*:
* Sensual desire, ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, doubt

=== Scientific Relevance

This framework tries to map onto modern psychological constructs:

- *Kilesas*: Maladaptive cognitive-emotional patterns
- *Karmic seeds*: Latent psychological dispositions
- *Ripening*: Context dependent expression of traits
- *Path stages*: Progressive psychological well-being and wisdom development

== Motivation

I was motivated by my own meditation practice and the desire to
better understand and predict how my practice might influence attainment of
Nibbāna. I wanted to create this model may be due to my desire for enlightenment
and the lack of a simulator for the karmic and kilesa dynamics described in
Thēravāda Buddhism. While there could be many computational models of general
psychology, I felt none specifically address the pragmatic features of
Thēravāda modeling.

=== Potential Research Questions

* How do different meditation practices affect specific categories of mental defilements?
* What are the optimal practice combinations for different personality types?
* How do early meditation experiences predict long-term contemplative development?
* Can we identify biomarkers that correlate with traditional _path attainment_ descriptions?
* What environmental and social factors facilitate or hinder contemplative development?

== Model Architecture

=== Hidden Markov Model Structure

*Hidden States*: Current kilesa activation levels and accumulated karmic potential

- 28 dimensional state vector covering canonical defilements
- Dynamic evolution based on intentional actions and environmental contexts

*Observable States*: Behavioral manifestations and life circumstances

- Emotional reactions, relationship patterns, decision-making tendencies
- Life events, opportunities, challenges, and general well-being indicators

*Transition Probabilities*: Action-based state evolution

- Driven by cetana (intention) strength and kilesa combinations
- Modified by meditation practice effects and path attainment levels
- Influenced by environmental context and social factors

=== Key Contributions

. *Sophisticated Ripening Mechanisms*
* Context-aware triggering based on life circumstances
* Multiple timescales (immediate, next-life, later-lives, indefinite)
* Realistic decay functions for different kilesa types

. *Meditation Practice Integration*
* Practice-specific effects (metta vs vipassana vs samatha)
* Dose-response relationships based on duration, consistency, quality
* Teacher guidance and retreat experience factors

. *Path Stage Modeling*
* Precise kilesa elimination patterns matching traditional descriptions
* Stream Entry, Once-Returner, Non-Returner, Arahant stages
* Manual path stage setting with immediate kilesa elimination upon attainment

. *Rebirth Circumstance Prediction*
* Detailed life condition modeling based on karmic patterns
* Realm, family, physical, mental, and spiritual circumstances
* Testable through longitudinal studies of life trajectory patterns

== Core Features

=== Comprehensive Kilesa Coverage

* *28 canonical defilements* from Abhidhamma and Suttas sources only
* *Interaction patterns* between different kilesa types (18 interactions implemented)
* *Decay rates* reflecting traditional understanding of defilement persistence

=== Multi-dimensional Meditation Effects

[source,python]
----
# Example: Loving-kindness practice specifically counters hatred-based kilesas
if practice.practice_type == MeditationType.METTA:
    hatred_kilesas = ['hatred', 'anger', 'ill_will', 'hostility', 'aversion']
    for kilesa in hatred_kilesas:
        modified[kilesa] *= (1 - suppression_factor * 1.5)  # 1.5x effectiveness
----

*Currently Implemented Practice Types*:

* `METTA` - Loving-kindness meditation
* `VIPASSANA` - Insight meditation
* `SAMATHA` - Concentration meditation
* `SATIPATTHANA` - Mindfulness of foundations
* `ANAPANASATI` - Mindfulness of breathing
* `KASINA` - Concentration objects

The two big umbrellas of meditation are:

* Samatha (calm, tranquility, concentration)
* Vipassanā (insight, wisdom, seeing things as they really are)

Everything else listed is not a _third type_ but rather methods
that fall under one or both of those two categories.

=== Sophisticated Ripening Triggers

[source,python]
----
# Context-aware karmic ripening
ripening_prob = seed.calculate_ripening_probability(
    current_context, meditation_suppression
)
# Includes: strength_factor, context_match, suppression_factor, timing_factor
----

=== Path Stage Precision

[source,python]
----
# Stream Entry eliminates first three fetters completely
if stage == PathStage.STREAM_ENTRY:
    modified['personality_view'] = 0.0  # Complete elimination
    modified['doubt'] = 0.0
    modified['rites_rituals'] = 0.0
    # All other kilesas reduced by 40%
    for other_kilesas: modified[kilesa] *= 0.6
----

=== Comprehensive Visualization

* *Karmic evolution charts* showing long-term accumulation patterns
* *Kilesa activation heatmaps* revealing practice effects over time
* *Path progression tracking* with meditation influence indicators
* *Rebirth circumstance analysis* for life trajectory prediction

== Implementation Details

=== Core Classes

. *`TheravadaKarmaHMM`*: Main model orchestrating all dynamics
. *`KarmicSeed`*: Individual action consequences with sophisticated ripening logic
. *`KilesamState`*: Current mental defilement configuration
. *`MeditationPractice`*: Practice parameters with realistic effect calculations
. *`RebirthCircumstance`*: Detailed life condition prediction framework
. *`RipeningTrigger`*: Context dependent ripening conditions

=== Enums and Types

* *`PathStage`*: ORDINARY, STREAM_ENTRY, ONCE_RETURNER, NON_RETURNER, ARAHANT
* *`RebirthRealm`*: HELL, ANIMAL, GHOST, HUMAN, DEVA, BRAHMA
* *`MeditationType`*: SAMATHA, VIPASSANA, SATIPATTHANA, ANAPANASATI, METTA, KASINA
* *`RipeningType`*: IMMEDIATE, NEXT_LIFE, LATER_LIVES, INDEFINITE

=== Algorithmic Approach

[source,python]
----
# Simplified action processing pipeline
def perform_action(intention_strength, active_kilesas, wholesome=False):
    # 1. Apply path modifications (eliminate relevant kilesas)
    modified_kilesas = apply_path_modifications(active_kilesas)

    # 2. Calculate kilesa interactions (reinforcement/suppression)
    effective_intensities = calculate_kilesa_interactions(modified_kilesas)

    # 3. Apply meditation suppression effects
    final_intensities = apply_meditation_effects(effective_intensities)

    # 4. Create karmic seeds with sophisticated trigger conditions
    seeds = create_karmic_seeds(final_intensities, intention_strength)

    # 5. Update state and log for analysis
    update_state_and_log(seeds)

    return seeds

=== Kilesa Interactions Implemented

The model implements few kilesa interactions. There could be up to 378 or more
possible pairwise interactions, but only the most significant ones are included
based on my understanding.

== Research Applications

=== Immediate Research Opportunities

. *Meditation Dose-Response Studies*
* Use model predictions to design optimal practice schedules
* Test specific practice combinations for different personality types
* Investigate threshold effects for contemplative development stages

. *Biomarker Correlation Research*

* Identify early indicators of deeper contemplative development
* Develop assessment tools for contemplative progress

. *Intervention Design*
* Create personalized meditation programs based on individual kilesa profiles
* Design targeted practices for specific mental health conditions
* Optimize retreat structures and teacher training programs

=== Longitudinal Study Framework

The model provides a theoretical framework for multi-decade longitudinal studies:

[source,python]
----
# Example research protocol
def longitudinal_study_protocol():
    # Baseline assessment
    initial_state = assess_kilesa_profile(participant)

    # Practice intervention
    practice_program = design_personalized_practice(initial_state)

    # Periodic assessment
    for year in study_duration:
        current_state = assess_current_kilesas(participant)
        life_events = record_life_circumstances(participant)
        practice_adherence = measure_practice_consistency(participant)

        # Model prediction vs. actual outcome
        predicted_state = model.advance_time(365, practice_program, life_events)
        prediction_accuracy = compare_states(predicted_state, current_state)

        # Model refinement
        if prediction_accuracy < threshold:
            refine_model_parameters(predicted_state, current_state)
----

=== Cross Cultural Research

* *Validation across contemplative traditions*: Test model generalizability
* *Cultural adaptation studies*: Examine via simulation on how social context affects contemplative development

. *Face Validity*: Extensive review by Buddhist scholars and meditation teachers
. *Construct Validity*: Correlation with established psychological measures
. *Predictive Validity*: Longitudinal study outcome prediction
. *Cross cultural Validity*: Testing across different Buddhist traditions

=== Current Limitations

. *Parameter Estimation*: Many parameters are theoretically derived rather than empirically fitted
. *Individual Differences*: Limited modeling of personality and genetic factors
. *Cultural Context*: Primarily based on traditional South Asian Buddhist contexts
. *Measurement Challenges*: Difficulty in directly measuring "kilesas" in research settings
. *Manual Path Attainment*: No automatic triggering of path stages based on conditions
. *Limited Kilesa Interactions*: Only 18 out of possible 378 kilesa pairs modeled
